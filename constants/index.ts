    question: 'How long does it take to learn an instrument?',
    answer: 'Learning an instrument is a personal journey that varies based on factors like practice consistency, prior musical experience, and your goals. Most students can play simple songs within 2-3 months, while developing intermediate skills typically takes 1-2 years of regular practice.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to own an instrument to start lessons?',

  },
  {
    question: 'What age groups do you teach?',
    answer: 'We welcome students of all ages! For children, we typically recommend starting around age 6-7 for most instruments, though this can vary based on the instrument and the child\'s development.'
